# Adding the Alien Lifestyles Logo

To display the Alien Lifestyles logo in the setup UI:

1. Place your logo image file in this directory (`src/setup/public/`)
2. Name it exactly: `alien-lifestyles-logo.png`
3. Supported formats: PNG, SVG, JPG (PNG recommended for transparency)

The logo should be:
- High resolution (at least 200px wide recommended)
- Transparent background (if using PNG)
- Optimized for web (under 500KB)

If the logo file is not found, a fallback "AL" text logo will be displayed instead.

Current expected path: `src/setup/public/alien-lifestyles-logo.png`
